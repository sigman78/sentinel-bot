# CLAUDE.md

## Project
Scaffold project of self evolving personal AI assistant, see @README.md

## Rules
Built using python, dependencies managed by 'uv'.

Code must be self-explanatory but terse, targeted for machine ingestion and understanding.
Try to adhere to type-safety but not overburden with excessive typing if deduce is trivial.
Keep module level documents with module info index, architecture and plans.

Use best dev practices - testing, reviewing, linting.

Manage context. If multiple agents is available - use action targeted: planning, researching, specific task coding, testing, reviewing.

## Tools
Its a bootstrap, you can use only one which is built-in.
