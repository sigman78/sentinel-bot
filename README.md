# Project Sentinel

This is a scaffold for building and continious evolution of personal AI agents swarm.

## Key features and operating rules

 - Orchestrates multiple specialized agents, each with own context, own and shared/specialized memories
 - Proactively and asynchronously manages context and memories of agents: like sleep agent, awarness agent etc
 - Builds and controls own memory hierarchy - user profile, user environment profile [personal, work], short-term memory, long-term memory, world model
 - Utilizes multimodal AI to human interface [starting with chat apps, text, images, voice messages, reactions]
 - Code style optimized for machine understanding - saving tokens, duplicating information only where it matters for context
 - Sandbox for self-improving modification - a harness of tests when agents edit own code before changes are accepted
 - Safety first - analyze outcomes of operations, keeps personal information safe (unless given a permission)
